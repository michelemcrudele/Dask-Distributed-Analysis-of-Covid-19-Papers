# Dask-Distributed-Analysis-of-Covid-19-Papers
In this project we use Dask to distribute the analysis of COVID-19 related papers and do the following tasks:
1. Implement word counter algorithm to check the more recurrent words in the papers;
2. Discover the best and worst represented countries in the research;
3. Get the embedding of the papers;
4. Compute the cosine similiarity between each title of the papers and find out a couple of papers with the highest cosine similiarity score.
